# Offline Capability Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of offline capability for the Calorie Counter App using service workers. Service workers enable the app to work offline by caching assets, handling network requests, and providing fallback content when the user is offline.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Service Worker Registration

- Added `serviceWorkerRegistration.ts` to handle service worker registration
- Updated `index.tsx` to register the service worker
- Implemented update notification system to alert users when new content is available

### 2. Service Worker Implementation

- Created `service-worker.ts` using Workbox libraries for reliable service worker behavior
- Implemented different caching strategies for various types of requests:
  - Network First strategy for API requests
  - Cache First strategy for static assets (CSS, JS, fonts)
  - Stale While Revalidate strategy for images

### 3. Offline Experience

- Added an offline fallback page (`public/offline.html`) that displays when the user is offline
- Created an `OfflineIndicator` component to notify users when they're offline
- Implemented automatic retry when connection is restored

### 4. Update Detection

- Added a notification system to inform users when a new version of the app is available
- Implemented a "refresh" button to allow users to immediately update to the latest version
- Added custom event dispatching for better integration with React components

### 5. Build Configuration

- Updated the Craco configuration to use Workbox for service worker generation
- Configured proper caching and precaching of essential resources
- Set up file size limits and exclusions for better performance

## Testing

The offline capability can be tested by:
1. Loading the app in a browser
2. Using browser DevTools to simulate offline mode
3. Reloading the page - the app should still function with cached data
4. Checking that the offline indicator appears when in offline mode

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the offline capability:
1. Implement background sync for pending API requests
2. Add more sophisticated conflict resolution when reconnecting after offline changes
3. Enhance the offline UI with more detailed status information
4. Implement periodic revalidation of cached data when online
