# Project Status and Next Steps

## Completed Tasks

### Frontend
- Updated the index.tsx to use AppRouter for proper authentication flow
- Added API service for future backend integration
- Created a custom hook (useFoodEntries) to provide a unified way to access food entries
- Built the UI components for the calorie tracking application including:
  - Dashboard with weekly overview
  - Food entry form for adding new items
  - Calendar view for month-based navigation
  - Daily detail and timeline views
- **Improved Form Validation**: Added robust validation to the FoodEntryForm with error messages and user feedback
- **API Integration**: Updated the useFoodEntries hook to use the API service when authenticated

### Backend
- Set up the Express server with TypeScript
- Created MongoDB schemas for User and FoodEntry models
- Implemented authentication controllers with JWT
- Implemented food entry controllers for CRUD operations
- Added routes for all API endpoints
- Set up authentication middleware for protected routes
- **Database Connection**: Set up MongoDB connection with proper error handling
- **Validation**: Added input validation using express-validator for all food entry endpoints

## Next Steps

### Frontend
1. **Test API Integration**: Thoroughly test the API integration with the backend
   - Ensure data flows correctly between frontend and backend
   - Add proper error handling for API failures

2. **Enhanced Analytics**: Add more analytics features to the dashboard
   - Create visualizations for nutritional breakdown
   - Add trends over time

3. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Test and improve the responsive design
   - Ensure all components work well on smaller screens

### Backend
1. **Testing**: Create unit and integration tests
   - Test all API endpoints
   - Mock database for testing

2. **Documentation**: Create API documentation
   - Document all endpoints with example requests and responses
   - Use Swagger or similar tool for interactive documentation

3. **Deployment**: Prepare for production deployment
   - Set up proper environment configuration
   - Create deployment scripts

## Known Issues
- Authentication system needs further testing with the backend integration
- No proper error handling for all API failures
- Need to test with real MongoDB instance

## Future Enhancements
- Voice input for food entries
- Barcode scanning for packaged foods
- Social sharing features
- Export data to CSV/PDF
- Meal planning features
