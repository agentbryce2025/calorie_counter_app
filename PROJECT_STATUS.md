   - Document all endpoints with example requests and responses
   - Use Swagger or similar tool for interactive documentation

3. **Deployment**: Prepare for production deployment
   - Set up proper environment configuration
   - Create deployment scripts

## Known Issues
- Authentication system needs further testing with a real backend deployment
- Need to test with real MongoDB instance in production-like environment
- Frontend development server has occasional compilation issues that need further investigation
